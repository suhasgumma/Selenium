Brief Research:

File System is a process to see where and how tha data is stored in the HDD.


Test Case 1:

Make sure that the user could not touch the Kernel Programs and UNAUTHOURISED Files.

Test Set: When Multiple physical units are present

Test Case 2: Make Sure that the alloted space and used space are correct.



Test set : Maintaining Space and disk partitioning.

Test Case 3: make Sure That the Fragmentation is done correctly.

Test Case 4: Remaining free Space is calculated correctly in each partition.

When asked to partition...

Test Case 5: Check if there is enough space to make another partition of required size.

Test Case 6: If yes, make the partition and check the total space before partition and after partition is same.

Test Case 7: FINALLY, check individual sizes of partition.



Test Set: File names

Test Case 8: Two files with the same name should not be present in the same directory. Define what "same" means.

Test Set: Checking Heirarchial Structure of the directories.

Test Case 9: make sure that the Heirarchial tree is formed correctly when creating new directories inside the directory.



Test Set: Reading Files

Test Case: Make sure that we are Reading from the currect directory and the currect file.

Test Set: Writing Files.

Test Case 11: MAke sure that the same file is not being updated in Multiple instances at the same time.

Test Case 12 : Maintaining Integrity: If the write operation is terminated in the middle, 
            EITHER save changes until termination... 
            OR Dont change the pre existing File.

Test Set: Maintainance of Meta data

Test case 13: If some instance of the file(like location, size, Name , extension , etc) is changed, make sure that the meta data is also updated.

Test Set : Restriction of access.

** When Read only**
Test Case 14: Make Sure Giving access when Read.
Test Case 15: MAke sure not Giving access when updating.


Test Case 16: if password is set, it should prompt "enter password" and access is given only when password is right.

***Correctness IS DOne******


Performance testing..

Test Case 17: Efficiency of search.

Test Case 18: Speed of read, write and retrieve.


Load Test:

Check when reading and writing large files.
